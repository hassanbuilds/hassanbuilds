## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught Flutter front-end developer and a Computer Science student from Pakistan 🇵🇰.  
I specialize in building modern mobile applications using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, with a strong emphasis on **clean UI**, **performance**, and **responsive design**.

I enjoy transforming real-world ideas into intuitive mobile apps and follow best practices in **scalable code architecture**, **state management**, and **UI/UX** design.  

💼 I'm actively seeking an **internship or junior Flutter developer role** where I can apply my skills, grow with a team, and contribute to real-world projects.
