## 📌 About Me

I'm a self-taught Flutter front-end developer and a Computer Science student from Pakistan 🇵🇰.  
I specialize in building modern mobile applications using Flutter and Firebase, with a strong emphasis on clean UI, performance, and responsive design.

I enjoy transforming real-world ideas into intuitive mobile apps and follow best practices in scalable code architecture, state management, and UI/UX design.

🔍 I'm actively seeking an internship or junior Flutter developer role where I can apply my skills, grow with a team, and contribute to real-world projects.
